Luca Weishaupt (260823598) and Hugo Baraër (260927183) both contributed 
equally on that laboratory. The whole laboratory was done while in a zoom 
call, during the lab, and some messenger calls. There was screen sharing 
at all time, and the driver/navigator alternated. L. Weishaupt was the 
driver for the functions defining the position, the histogram, the plot 
of the flux variation against the distance and the polishing of the code. 
H. Baraër was the driver for the creation of the 2d histogram images, the 
creation of the GIF, and the function for defining distances and the flux 
variation with the number of stars and their position. Both authors 
contributed actively during their navigator position.
